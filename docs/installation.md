# Installing the kit

After signing in, open **الإعداد الأولي** to review identity and test notifications, mail receipt, storage and runtime services. See [initial setup](initial-setup.md).

Version **0.2.0-alpha.1 is unreleased**. The npm scope is reserved, but no package has been published. Use local archives until an authorized release exists.

## New application: one command

After publication, the standalone initializer is:

```sh
npm create @adula/app@alpha my-app
```

This follows npm's [scoped initializer convention](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-init/): `@adula/app` resolves to `@adula/create-app`. It does not require an existing AdonisJS application. Node.js 24+ and npm are host prerequisites. The default requires installed/running Docker with Compose; it runs PostgreSQL 17 and Redis 7 in isolated local containers with persistent volumes and loopback ports. Alternatively pass `--services existing --connection /path/to/local.json`; see [creator options](../packages/create-app/README.md).

The wizard requests company identity and administrator email, downloads pnpm and dependencies, creates fresh development and `_test` databases, applies migrations, installs the managed skills and project-owned shadcn UI, initializes the administrator, checks doctor/types and builds assets. Credentials go to ignored `tmp/dev-admin.txt`; company identity goes to project-owned `docs/design-identity.md`. No educational modules are included. Existing files and database names are protected from replacement.

Terminal instructions are English; the application stays Arabic. Interactive terminals show color and a spinner across six stages; `NO_COLOR=1` or redirected output produces plain lines. Detailed installation output is in ignored `tmp/install.log`.

Before publication, first run `pnpm test:create` in this repository to produce the three verified archives. Then invoke the creator using their actual absolute paths:

```sh
npm exec --yes --package=/path/to/adula-create-app-0.2.0-alpha.1.tgz -- create-adula my-app --packages /path/to/archives
```

Run `npm run dev` inside the created application. Workers/scheduler are separate runtime processes described in its README. The creator installs application dependencies and local services; Node/Docker installation, real SMTP, OAuth, S3, off-site backup and production hosting remain explicit host/service configuration.

## Prerequisites for an existing application

Use Node 24 or newer, pnpm 11.19.0, the official AdonisJS 7 React/Inertia starter, and PostgreSQL 17. Configure Lucid with `pg`, authentication, session and shield. `configure @adula/kit` refuses missing prerequisites or a non-PostgreSQL connection.

The tested copied UI host uses React 19, Tailwind CSS 4.3.3, `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.3.3 and shadcn 4.21.0. Install registry components through the kit command so ownership tracking remains intact.

## Prepare archives

In the source repository, `pnpm test:consumer` builds and packs both packages into `.work`, then verifies them in an independent application. To pack without the consumer test, build each package and run `pnpm --filter @adula/kit pack --pack-destination <absolute-output-directory>` and the same command for `@adula/ui`. Use an existing absolute output path to avoid package-relative ambiguity.

## Configure an existing consumer

Inside your configured application, install the archives using their actual paths. Replace the illustrative paths below:

```sh
pnpm add /path/to/adula-kit-0.2.0-alpha.1.tgz /path/to/adula-ui-0.2.0-alpha.1.tgz
pnpm add tailwindcss@4.3.3
pnpm add -D shadcn@4.21.0 @tailwindcss/vite@4.3.3
node ace configure @adula/kit
node ace migration:run
```

Configuration registers providers/commands and migration discovery, and copies application-owned service/controller/routes and the HTTP test helper without overwriting customizations. It configures the Japa plugins for generated tests.

Create the intended administrator through your application's signup flow. Set `ADULA_ADMIN_EMAIL` to that existing account in your environment, then run:

```sh
node ace adula:install
node ace adula:doctor
```

Installation bootstraps core administrator authorization, synchronizes managed AGENTS rules/skills, and installs the UI registry when `@adula/ui` is present. Customized components are protected. It does not supply all reference-app authentication/admin screens or automatically wire every optional adapter; consuming applications own that integration.

Repeated installation also repairs a missing bootstrap `manage all` grant for an existing administrator role. It preserves other rules, including explicit denies. Normal administration prevents removal of the last active administrator and removal of the acting administrator's own access. See [ADR 019](decisions/019-admin-safety-and-calendar-preferences.md).

The generated settings page offers Gregorian, Umm al-Qura Hijri, or both calendars. Both mode shows two representations of one stored date and lets users choose the input calendar. It also controls edit-dialog dismissal confirmation and page transitions; reduced motion is respected. Existing consumers must merge updated application-owned pages/middleware and review registry changes through `adula:ui` before adopting these defaults.

After publication, replace archives with the **exact published version** of each package. Do not assume 1.0 already exists.

## First domain resource and design

Run `node ace adula:resource inspections --module=inspections`, fill the generated labels, fields, validation and test fixture, then migrate and test. The kit installs no customers/orders/tasks modules; the repository's examples are test-only.

At kickoff the design agent requests company name, logo, approved colors, fonts and brand guidelines, reuses supplied information, and records sources in project-owned `docs/design-identity.md`. Pending assets allow independent work with a provisional neutral preview. Installation never overwrites that document.

UI work uses `.agents/skills/adula-frontend-design/SKILL.md`, local shadcn components, and Dialog for forms/row details by default. Explicit user requests can choose a full page. Preview updates with `node ace adula:ui add all --preview` and review customized files before merging.

## Meaning of one-command installation

`npm create @adula/app@alpha my-app` creates and initializes a complete application from an empty folder after the creator is published. `node ace adula:install` initializes the kit inside an existing AdonisJS application. The plan's `make deploy` deploys an application; it is not an npm installer.
